# Jitsi Cluster

![Jitsi Cluster](/docs/images/jitsi-cluster.png)

`LXC` based `Jitsi` cluster on `Debian 11 Bullseye`.

## Installation

See [the deployment guide](/INSTALL.md).

## Why

Deploying a `Jitsi` cluster is a complex task and requires a lot of specific
configurations on each component to function properly. This repository contains
tools that simplify the deployment processes and automatically configure each component
without any user interaction.
